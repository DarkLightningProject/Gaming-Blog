This is my first blog project, and while there may be some initial mistakes, I kindly ask for your understanding and patience. Please note that after creating a post, it must first be approved via the admin panel (using a superuser created through the createsuperuser command) before being displayed on the blog.

The project, titled gamingblog, includes images to illustrate how the website will appear, which can be found in the corresponding folder.

The following are the prerequisites and dependencies required for the project:

Install Django using the command: pip install django
Install django-crispy-forms: pip install django-crispy-forms
Install crispy-bootstrap5: pip install crispy-bootstrap5
Install django-ckeditor: pip install django-ckeditor
Please note that the package django-tinymce is not used in this project. Therefore, it should be removed from the settings and URLs configuration.

Thank you for your support and understanding.
